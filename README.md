# thermography-of-Breast-cancer
detect the breast cancer from thermography images of breast:
Due to the large number of images, I uploaded one of them.
These images are divided into two classes: healthy and sample or unhealthy
This project has the highest received accuracy and has been with machine learning and SVM classification.
The images are taken from the front and top angles of the breast. In these images, the places with high temperature are marked with a red spectrum, 
which probably has a mass. For this purpose, 
the histogram of these images and Laplacin have been used in the pre-processing
For this purpose, I have processed the received images first into two dimensions and then processed the images
Histogram and Laplacian commands, Gaussian diagram and median filter have been used as features
In the following, the characteristics are used as the input of the classification and the classes are used as the target
